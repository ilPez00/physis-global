# Physis Engine — Development Plan

## Overview

Physis is moving from a single-threaded ontological mapper into a **holarchic runtime**
with real-time graph processing, semantic classification, temporal scheduling, and
distributed dream synchronization.

---

## Phase 1: Holarchy & Real-time Graph (Current — In Progress)

### Graph Engine (`graph.rs`)
- `DenseSlotMap<NodeKey, NodePayload>` with `Pod`-compatible zero-copy types
- `Edge` with semantic type and weight — `MmappedStorage` for persist
- ONNX worker thread processes graph nodes asynchronously via `crossbeam_channel`
- `RawNodeKey` bridges graph internals with serialization boundaries

**Status**: DenseSlotMap, Pod types, Edge, NodePayload, MmappedStorage, ONNX worker channel — done.
**Next**: Graph traversal (BFS/DFS), subgraph extraction, causal path search.

### Rachmaninov Holon (`rachmaninov.rs`)
- PDCA-driven directive engine: `Focus`, `Expand`, `Prune`, `Synthesize` directives
- `tick(state_vector)` compares state vs goal vector, emits directives on drift
- Designed as a control holon that reads graph state and writes directives back

**Status**: Core tick cycle, directive types, similarity threshold gating — done.
**Next**: Wire tick output into graph mutation pipeline, add directive priority sorting.

### Sensory Pipeline (`sensory.rs`)
- Raw sensor payloads as `Pod` structs — `SensorPayload` with timestamp + f32x4 vector
- Bridge between real-world input (filesystem, network, audio) and graph node space
- Packed binary format for zero-copy mmap storage

**Status**: Data types, serialization — done.
**Next**: Ingestion from audio/network sources, real-time node creation on sensor fire.

### ONNX Worker (`ai/onnx_worker.rs`)
- Background thread pool processing embedding requests
- Request/response channel pattern — non-blocking for the web server
- Pool of active `NdTensor` views for batch inference

**Status**: Thread pool, channel plumbing, ndarray shape fix (3D → flat index) — done.
**Next**: Batch queue with priority, streaming inference, GPU fallback detection.

---

## Phase 2: Semantic Embedding & Classification

### ONNX MiniLM (done)
- Production-grade 384-d embeddings via `ort` runtime + `tokenizers` crate
- Falls back to deterministic `RandomProjectionEmbedder` when model absent
- Enabled with `--features embed-onnx`

### Query Classification (done)
- `POST /api/v1/classify` — embed query text → cosine sim against per-cell centroids
- Centroids pre-computed at startup from all 511 ontology entries (name + hints averaged per DOMAIN×MODE cell)
- Returns sorted `ClassifyResult[]` with domain, mode, score, matched ontology entries

---

## Phase 3: Gantt & Temporal Scheduling

### Gantt Engine (`gantt.rs`)
- `GanttTask` with start/end, dependencies, resource allocation
- `RawNodeKey` integration — tasks reference graph nodes
- Critical path analysis and resource leveling

**Status**: Data structures — done (stub).
**Next**: Causal-aware scheduling (failures push dates, successes pull them in), temporal coherence scoring, Gantt → Mermaid renderer.

---

## Phase 4: Distributed Physis

### MCP Mesh
- Global UberWiki sync between instances via MCP
- `physis_ingest_prompt` → local goal → remote broadcast
- Dream pattern sharing across instances

**Status**: MCP server/client stubs — done.
**Next**: Conflict resolution for concurrent writes, partial sync (subscribe to branches), latency-tolerant dream merging.

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Dreaming

### Graph-based Dreams
- Dream generation traverses graph edges instead of linear vector interpolation
- ONNXWorker-assisted dream evaluation (semantic plausibility scoring)
- Dream → subgraph extraction → directive queue

**Status**: Linear stochastic dreams (mutation/graft/prune) — done.
**Next**: Graph-aware mutation (prune failed subgraphs, expand coherent ones), predictive coherence simulation, cross-instance dream comparison.

---

## Phase 6: Multi-Modal Embedding & Ontology Expansion 🔄 IN PROGRESS

This phase is the answer to: *"What if we could classify images, audio, processes — not just text? And what if the ontology was deep enough to distinguish a welding robot from a chef?"*

### 6A. Multi-Embedder Architecture

Replace the single `Box<dyn VectorEmbed>` with a **trait-typed registry** that dispatches by modality and model type.

**Status**: ✅ Done — `EmbedderRegistry`, `EmbedderKindConfig`, `EmbeddersConfig` in `config.rs`; fallback chain primary → Jina → CLIP → MiniLM → RP in both `web_server.rs` and `cli.rs`.

**Design**:

```rust
/// Which model to use for a given modality
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum EmbedderKind {
    RandomProjection,
    MiniLM,
    CLIP,
    JinaV2,
    SigLIP,
    ImageBind,   // Python sidecar; ONNX unavailable
}

/// What kind of input we're embedding
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum Modality {
    Text,
    Image,
    Audio,
    /// Structured process graph → vector
    Process,
}

/// Registry holds one embedder per modality, each with its own dimension
pub struct EmbedderRegistry {
    pub text: Box<dyn VectorEmbed>,
    pub image: Option<Box<dyn VectorEmbed>>,
    pub audio: Option<Box<dyn VectorEmbed>>,
    pub config: EmbedderConfig,
}
```

**Config** (`PhysisConfig` addition):

```json
{
  "embedders": {
    "text": { "kind": "jina-v2", "model_dir": "./models/jina-v2" },
    "image": { "kind": "clip", "model_dir": "./models/clip-vision" },
    "audio": null
  }
}
```

**At startup**: each configured embedder loads independently. If model files are missing, the embedder is `None` and falls back gracefully. Centroids are computed once per text embedder (for text queries). Image queries skip centroids and go direct to generative classification or use CLIP's shared text-image space.

**Key files**: `src/embed/registry.rs` (new), `src/config.rs` (extend), `src/bin/web_server.rs` (use registry).

### 6B. CLIP Implementation (OpenAI) ✅ Done

**Status**: ✅ `src/embed/clip.rs` implements `ClipEmbedder` with separate ONNX sessions for text and vision, L2-normalized 512-d output, uses Xenova pre-exported models from HuggingFace.

**Download** (user-side, one command):

```bash
# CLIP models from HuggingFace ONNX export
pip install optimum onnx
optimum-cli export onnx --model openai/clip-vit-base-patch32 ./models/clip-vit-base-patch32
```

Produces:
- `models/clip-vit-base-patch32/text_model.onnx` — text encoder (512-d)
- `models/clip-vit-base-patch32/vision_model.onnx` — vision encoder (512-d)
- `models/clip-vit-base-patch32/tokenizer.json`

**Rust implementation** (`src/embed/clip.rs`):

```rust
pub struct ClipEmbedder {
    text_session: Mutex<Session>,
    vision_session: Mutex<Session>,
    tokenizer: tokenizers::Tokenizer,
    dim: usize, // 512
}

impl ClipEmbedder {
    pub fn embed_text(&self, text: &str) -> Vec<f32> { ... }
    pub fn embed_image(&self, bytes: &[u8]) -> Vec<f32> {
        // decode JPEG/PNG → RGB f32 tensor
        // resize to 224×224
        // normalize with CLIP mean/std
        // run vision_model.onnx
        // L2-normalize output
    }
}
```

**Image pipeline**: The `image` crate is already a dependency. Decode → resize with `image::DynamicImage::resize_exact(224, 224, ...)` → normalize per CLIP's ImageNet stats (mean=[0.481, 0.457, 0.408], std=[0.268, 0.261, 0.275]) → f32 tensor → ONNX session → 512-d vector.

**CLIP's superpower**: text and image live in the same vector space. You can classify an image without any image-specific centroid — just embed the photo and compare against the same text centroids. A photo of a gym gets HEAL×LIFT 0.91 automatically.

### 6C. Jina CLIP v2 Implementation ✅ Done

**Status**: ✅ `src/embed/jina.rs` implements `JinaEmbedder` with fused ONNX session for text+vision, pre-normalized 1024-d outputs, dummy tensors for single-modality runs.

**Download**:

```bash
# Jina CLIP v2 — 1024-d, multilingual, open weights
optimum-cli export onnx --model jinaai/jina-clip-v2 ./models/jina-clip-v2
```

**Why Jina v2 over CLIP**:
- 1024-d vs 512-d — richer representation
- Multilingual (handles Italian prompts natively)
- Beats CLIP on zero-shot classification benchmarks
- Same text+image shared space architecture

**Rust implementation** (`src/embed/jina.rs`): mirrors CLIP but with 1024-d output and Jina's tokenizer config.

### 6D. SigLIP (Google) — Optional

SigLIP uses a sigmoid loss instead of CLIP's contrastive, yielding better separation. ONNX export same pattern. 768-d. Drop-in replacement for CLIP.

### 6E. ImageBind (Meta) — Optional Python Sidecar

ImageBind embeds **6 modalities** into one space: text, image, audio, depth, thermal, IMU. No ONNX export exists; runs in Python.

**Sidecar design**: lightweight Python process (FastAPI or stdio) that:
- Listens on a local port or stdin
- Accepts base64-encoded bytes + modality label
- Returns 1024-d vector
- Physis calls it as a subprocess or HTTP sidecar

**Worth it only if you need audio embedding natively** (no Whisper STT). For audio, the simpler path is Whisper STT → text embed, which avoids the sidecar.

### 6F. Ontology Expansion — 5 Domains × 6 Modes, Deep

The current 511 entries cover 22 populated cells. Goal: fill all 30 cells with **at least 30 entries each** (900+ total), for both human and machine, with rich multi-lingual hints.

**Strategy**: expand each domain×mode cell by adding new entries derived from:
- **Human activities**: sports, crafts, professions, relationships, learning methods
- **Machine operations**: sensors, actuators, control loops, manufacturing, transport
- **Cross-domain**: activities that span human+machine (e.g. "welding" appears in both human FABRICATE×WORK and machine FABRICATE×WORK)

**Example expansion for HEAL×LIFT** (currently 1 entry: Body & Fitness):

| Entry | Hints | Kind |
|-------|-------|------|
| Body & Fitness | gym, lift, workout, run, yoga | human |
| Physical Therapy | rehab, physio, stretch, mobility | human |
| Heavy Lifting | crane, hoist, jack, forklift | machine |
| Structural Load | beam, column, load-bearing, stress-test | machine |
| Immune Response | antibody, lymphocyte, inflammation, fever | natural |
| Muscular Exertion | sprint, jump, throw, push, pull | human |
| Hydraulic Pressure | pump, cylinder, psi, actuator | machine |

**Each cell gets this treatment**: systematic domain analysis to find 20-40 distinct entries covering human, machine, natural, abstract, social, engineering, agent, semiotic, and category kinds.

**Impact**: centroids become denser, classification becomes sharper — a cooking photo won't accidentally score high on HEAL×LIFT because that cell now has 30 specific entries pulling its centroid toward actual lifting activities.

### 6G. Gemma as Ontology Mapper

Once the embedder architecture and expanded ontology are in place, Gemma enters as a **re-ranking / generative mapping layer** above the vector classification.

**Architecture**:

```
User input (text/image/audio)
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Fast Path: Vector Classify  │  ← 5ms, all 30 cells scored
│  (CLIP/Jina/MiniLM centroids)│
└──────────┬───────────────────┘
           │
     confidence > 0.75?
      ┌────┴────┐
      yes       no
      │         │
      ▼         ▼
   return    ┌──────────────────────────────┐
   result    │  Slow Path: Gemma Re-rank    │  ← 2-5s, top-3 cells
             │  "Given text X, which of     │     reasoned classification
             │   these 3 DOMAIN×MODE cells  │
             │   best fits? Explain why."   │
             └──────────┬───────────────────┘
                        ▼
                   return result
```

**Gemma as pure ontology mapper** (no centroids at all): remove the vector path entirely and prompt:

```
Classify the following text into one of these DOMAIN×MODE pairs.
Consider both the domain (HEAL, CONSTRUCT, FABRICATE, BOND, STUDY)
and the mode (LIFT, REST, WALK, WORK, CREATE, LEARN).

Text: "chopping vegetables for a hearty soup"
→ FABRICATE×CREATE (Culinary Arts, Cooking & Meal Prep)  — confidence: 0.94
→ HEAL×LIFT (Nutrition & Diet)                           — confidence: 0.82
→ ...
```

**Advantages of Gemma mapping**:
- No centroids to pre-compute or maintain
- Can reason about novel or ambiguous cases
- Understands context ("fixing a leaky pipe" = CONSTRUCT×WORK, not FABRICATE×WALK)
- Multimodal natively (Gemma 4 Vision)

**Disadvantages**:
- 2-5s per query on GPU (vs 5ms for vector)
- Can't be embedded in vector-space operations (dreams, PDCA, coherence scoring)
- Higher hardware requirements (8GB+ VRAM for 4B, 20GB+ for 9B)
- Temperature sensitivity — same input can map differently across runs

**Hybrid recommendation**: use vector centroids as the primary path (fast, deterministic, vector-compatible), and run Gemma as an optional **re-ranker for edge cases** and an **ontology expansion assistant** (Gemma suggests new entries and hints for cells).

|------|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `EmbedderRegistry` struct + config | — | 1 day | ✅ Done |
| 2 | CLIP text embedder (`src/embed/clip.rs`) | Steps 1 | 2 days | ✅ Done |
| 3 | CLIP vision embedder | Steps 2 | 2 days | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Jina v2 text+vision embedder (`src/embed/jina.rs`) | Steps 1 | 2 days | ✅ Done |
| 5 | SigLIP embedder (drop-in) | Steps 1 | 1 day | ⬜ Pending |
| 6 | ImageBind Python sidecar (optional) | Steps 1 | 2 days | ⬜ Pending |
| 7 | Ontology expansion — fill 30 cells to 30+ entries each | — | 3 days | ⬜ Pending |
| 8 | Multi-modal classify endpoint — accepts text + base64 image | Steps 3, 4 | 1 day | ✅ Done |
| 9 | Gemma re-ranker — confidence-gated generative path | Steps 8 | 2 days | ⬜ Pending |
| 10 | Process embedding — task graph → vector via Gemma structural summarization | Steps 9 | 2 days | ⬜ Pending |

### 6I. Key Decisions

- **All ONNX embedders share the `ort` runtime** — no additional C++ deps. The `image` crate (already in Cargo.toml) handles decode/resize.
- **Dimension mismatch** is handled by projecting to the embedder's native dim at embed time, and pooling centroids to the query embedder's dim at classify time. This means you can mix MiniLM centroids (384-d) with CLIP queries (512-d) via a learned linear projection or simple mean pooling.
- **Jina v2 is the recommended primary embedder** for both text and image: best accuracy, multilingual, open weights, ONNX-exportable.
- **CLIP is the recommended fallback**: smaller, faster, battle-tested.
- **Gemma is not an embedder replacement** — it's a complementary reasoning layer. The vector space stays the source of truth for PDCA, dreaming, and coherence.

Phase 6 is mostly independent of Phases 1-5 (new embedder module, new endpoints).
Only depends on Phase 2's centroid + classify infrastructure (already built).
